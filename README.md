# Contract-Automation
This is a small automation project used by a Ukrainian NGO.

The main purpose of this code is to create new contracts between volunteers and the NGO and fill a journal, which is another Google Spreadsheet. 
### Stepwise:
    1. Raw data from a source Spreadsheet is taken;
    2. Transformed;
    3. Some nouns need to change their form in Ukrainian language, so integration with ChatGPT was added;
    4. A template contract is filled with data;
    5. The new contract is stored in a folder in Google Drive;
    6. A journal for newly created contracts is filled. 

Users can interact with the script via a button in menu.
